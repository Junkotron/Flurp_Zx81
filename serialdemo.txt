Here is a cool demo you can do if you have a serial module six-pin.
There is a resistor network that takes down the 5volt types down,
theoretically the read-line to the module could also have some pull-ups
that could be damaging to FPGA cmos but so far this has not happened,
using an all 3.3 volt serial might be advisable.

Here is the demo in which we surgically change the code from the outside
world.

I use minicom on Linux for this, 115200 No parity 8bits

Prepare the zeddy with a line like this "10 REM BRANDT"

  First we (h)alt the CPU

h
OK  (screen goes blank)

  Then we write into the linear memory SRAM on address 00082h
  (remember that this then maps to the Zeddy on address 4082h)

w 00082 a7.
OK

  Now we start the Zeddy again:

g
OK

  And doing "LIST" we should see that the "B" has now turned into inverse
  video.

Immensly funny...

Thats all for now!
