The Olimex board has to be programmed. I included a pre-built image if
you do not want to try the full synthesis chain with yosys and friends

It is all open-source now and Olimex has great support on their web page.

Anyway I recommend getting the "32u2" programmer also from the same company
It is most likely possible to use some other device but if you like me
dont need yet another hobby this is a great time-saver.

One connects the programmer to the fpga board via a 10-pin ribbon cable
(do not confuse this with the "Flurp" boards connector for Logic analyzer).

Then the programmer goes into the host PC via a USB cable.

The programmer needs to be programmed with the firmware, this is most
easily done via the Arduino gui and the .ino, again check out olimex
pages for this.

Once you gotten through the flashing led examples for the ice40 8k board
you can try to just download the firmware in the ice40hx8k/bin/
folder (toplevel.bin) via:

> sudo iceprogduino bin/toplevel.bin

or to check the whole sythesis toolchain, just type

> make


Failing this, the toplevel_hx8k.bin file can be found in the prefab/directory
(you still need to program the actual programmer with the arduino
 .ino sketch or of course use an entirely different solution)
